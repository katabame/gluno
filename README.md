## About Gluno

Gluno is a fork of Glu<u>on</u>. Which aims to provide more Deno-ish runtime
support.\
For more details about Glu<u>on</u>, please see
[upstream's readme](https://github.com/gluon-framework/gluon) or
[their website](https://gluonjs.org/).\
But here's simple explanation what Glu<u>on</u> is.

- Gluon is a new framework for creating desktop apps from websites.
- Gluon uses system installed browsers, not bundled browser or system webviews.
  - You have installed Chrome, Edge, Firefox (and Chromium-based) browser for
    daily uses isn't it?
  - Then why you have to use bundled browser or additional installed webview for
    running every single app?

## Gluno's Objective

- Support latest upstream Gluon
- Use typescript and provide types
- Follow the philosophy of Deno

## (Not) Frequently Asked Questions
- Why you use ðŸ•¯ emoji next to Gluon?
  - When I was starting this fork, I assumed Gluon's logo is a candle. (maybe it is a glue....)
- Where Gluno name cames from?
  - It's quite simple. Glu<u>on</u> + De<u>no</u>, just swapped last two letters.
